Plugins:
	Can know about the game, game cannot know about the plugin.

Heiarchy: 
Engine
	Plugin
		Game.

Not ideal: do not stack plugins. 


API tags expose our classes to the engine for manipulation.
if we do not want to expose it, we remove that tag. 


State Machine: 
Data -> Graph of nodes connected by branches. 
	So when we create it, we use Data Asset. 

Data Asset:
	Turns off features we do not need to best create our nodes for our states. 

DFA and NFA's:

Finite Automoton: 
	DFA : Deterministic Finite Automoton
	NFA : Non-Deterministic Finite Automoton

	Difference between the two:
		If you run a computer program. You cannot tell if the program is going to finish or get stuck in some infinite loop. 
	
	
so we're constructing a DFA:
	This means we're going to have a finite amount of steps that will have the states of Not Accepted, accepted, rejected, and out of steps. 



USM_Branch:
	Did I get there? If so, where?
	This will return where it got to or null on failure.
